### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anthony - a fullstack Product Engineer by day and open source software developer by night.<br>
I'm also Owner and Admin of the [Code CafÃ© discord server](https://discord.gg/code-cafe).

When I'm not contributing to open source, chances are I'm hiking or at the gym ðŸ¥Š

My current focus is on the BEAM languages Elixir and Gleam, however I also work professionally in Ruby and Typescript.
